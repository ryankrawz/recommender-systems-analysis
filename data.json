                    "text": "When an individual first opens a Stitch Fix account, the application administers a suite of assessments in an attempt to quantify certain aspects of their preferences. The assessments will ask the user for input ranging from how tightly they like their pant legs to their favorite colors and patterns to which types of clothing they would and would not wear. An example of the interface is below. Once the assessments are completed, Stitch Fix will then provide a user’s personal clothing metrics to the stylist they’re assigned. Next, the stylist hand picks a Fix, or a box of five articles of clothing, to ship to the user. Upon receival, the user can select which pieces they want to keep and which they want to return. Most customers elect to receive a Fix every two months. Users who have already ordered Fixes are also allowed to shop for clothes directly on the website, and Stitch Fix’s recommender system continues to help them in this regard. Based on what the user previously ordered, Stitch Fix will recommend pairings to include in a user’s outfit, as shown below."

                    "title": "Goals",
                    "image": "assets/product/stitchfixpeople.jpg",
                    "text": "The primary objective of Stitch Fix is for customers to keep every single item of clothing they are sent. In other words, Stitch Fix hopes to implement their recommender system so successfully that the selected clothing will exactly match the customer in their sizes, spending habits, and fashion tastes. In doing so, Stitch Fix can encourage users to rely strictly on its website to shop for clothes or have clothes provided for them. The tasks required in order for Stitch Fix to accomplish its goal can be broken down into two major stages. First, Stitch Fix must overcome the largest obstacle for nearly all machine learning pipelines: feature engineering. Essentially, Stitch Fix has to determine the quantitative measurement of a customer’s clothing profile by interpreting their reactions to the clothes they view. Say that during their assessment, a customer is presented with a red sweater, and the customer votes that they would indeed wear it. Based on the aspects of that sweater, what metrics in the user’s profile should be adjusted? Should there be a “color” metric that now leans more towards red? Should there be a “buttons” metric indicating that the customer prefers clothing without buttons? What about the rest of the outfit? Would the customer only wear that sweater with some outfits and not others? As the desired accuracy of Stitch Fix’s recommender system increases, the complexity of the required feature engineering behind the system expands at an exponential rate. Second, once Stitch Fix has a working model for a user’s profile, they must apply this model to the clothing selection process. It must be determined how the available inventory is to be ranked in terms of a customer’s preferences. For ranking to occur, Stitch Fix will need to calculate the probability of a customer wearing a certain clothing item, which involves negotiating that item’s features with the given customer profile. Then comes the human stylist. When all is said and done, it’s the stylist who curates the Fix for a customer. Stitch Fix must decide how information on rankings, probabilities, profiles, etc. is presented to the stylist and to what degree of freedom the stylist can select clothing that may conflict with the recommendation algorithm’s picks."

                    "title": "Strengths",
                    "image": "assets/product/stitchfixnav.png",
                    "text": "Stitch Fix should be applauded for its automation strategies, which have led the company to make leaps and bounds in operational efficiency. The clear example of automation is seen in the clothing recommender system, where a human stylist need not intervene until the very last step of the process before the Fix is shipped. However, a more nontrivial example lies in Stitch Fix’s warehouse assignment system. The possible delivery costs and speeds from each warehouse to the customer are constructed in a matrix, and then the system performs binary optimization to choose the best warehouse to ship from, saving money for the company and time for the customer. In addition, Stitch Fix boasts an incredibly attractive user experience. The company website makes the job for the user very simple. All the user has to do is peruse a stream of suggesting clothing, and click a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down” icon (as seen previously) depending on their reaction to the item. The website is also easily traversable. It takes one click for the user to navigate to their Fix management, shopping, past orders and feedback, cart, or profile. Below is the Stitch Fix home screen. The chosen styling for the website is decluttered, straightforward, and aesthetically pleasing."

                    "title": "Weaknesses",
                    "image": "assets/product/stitchfeatureengineering.png",
                    "text": "An obvious weakness for Stitch Fix is the presence of the human element involved in creating a customer’s Fix. The stylists employed by Stitch Fix represent more salary and benefit-related liability on the company balance sheet, and introduce a certain degree of bias to clothing selection since people lack the ability to make fully objective decisions. As a further note, the stylist is a pain point for both Stitch Fix and its customers. If a customer receives a poorly curated Fix, most of their frustration will be directed towards the stylist, and the company may be tempted to think the problem lies in the stylist and fail to continue developing the recommender system itself. One consideration for Stitch Fix is to apply natural language processing to user feedback in order to adjust a user’s profile as they rate the clothes they receive. Another, more implicit weakness for Stitch Fix will be harder to solve. On a fundamental level, Stitch Fix is attempting to create a feature engineering model for fashion itself. However, the concept of fashion is amorphous, and the tastes of the public are endlessly evolving, even to the point where some customers may not wear a single item from a Fix they received a few months ago. The machine learning process is difficult enough in fields like facial recognition, where researchers enjoy the luxury of the human facial structure taking hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years to change. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the task of reliably measuring and quantifying something as subjective and ill-defined as fashion."

                    "text": "Relative to other recommender systems like Spotify, Netflix, and Instagram, Stitch Fix has an advantage in the degree to which it can stylize its recommendations based on direct user input. Instead of simply recording that a user did or did not watch a show or listen to a song, Stitch Fix’s interface accepts specific data as to whether or not the user needed a different size, preferred a different color, was looking for a lower price, etc. This rich variety of data is much more useful for their machine learning pipeline and allows Stitch Fix to quickly adapt to a user’s tastes and preferences. On the downside, Stitch Fix faces the same challenges that almost all recommender systems face: identifying and cleaning features. Like the way Spotify must determine the factors that contributed to a user liking or disliking a song, Stitch Fix must develop a quantitative representation of a user’s reaction to clothing they receive. In order to strengthen its product, Stitch Fix will need to find the optimal balance between choosing too few features to inform its recommendations and, in machine learning terms, taking the kitchen sink."
